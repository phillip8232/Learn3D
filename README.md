# Learn3D

Learn3D is a simple, educational prototype game engine project that allows you to explore 2D and 3D models in the scenes. 

The engine comes with pre-loaded 2D and 3D models, giving you a range of objects to explore and learn from. Each model has different views, which can be toggled using the controls provided.
